long_description = """
The function is used as `$language_name(code)`, where `code` is the three-character language code.
It would typically be used to expand the `%language%` and `%_releaselanguage%` tags.

For example, `$language_name(%language%)` will return '**English**' if the language code is '**eng**',
or '**Gwich´in**' if the language code is '**gwi**', or even '**Klingon / tlhIngan-Hol**' if the code
is '**tlh**'. (Yes, Klingon is actually officially recognized in the ISO 639-3 list of languages.)

If an unknown code is entered, the function will return '**unknown**'. If there is no code entered,
'**missing**' will be returned.
